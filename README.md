# Chess

This is my go at implementing the game of Chess. My plan is to turn it into a
UCI frontend similar to programs like En Croissant or Nibbler. The program is
currently written in Python, but I have plans to rewrite it in C.

## Usage

This project is not even in alpha yet, so there are no official usage
instructions right now.
