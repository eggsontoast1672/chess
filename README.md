# Chess

This is my go at implementing the game of Chess. My plan is to turn it into a
UCI frontend similar to programs like En Croissant or Nibbler. The program is
written in Rust, as the U.S. government intended, I guess.

## Usage

A good old fashioned `cargo run` from the root of the project will get you up
and running in a jiffy.
